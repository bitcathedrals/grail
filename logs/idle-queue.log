summary: an idle queue to manage multiple idle hooks

description:

There are multiple modules that need an idle hook.
Implement a common idle hook. Make it so multiple
modules can run off it.

[elisp/idle-queue.el]: implement the new manager
  * write the new functionality

[elisp/command-queue]: update to use idle queue
  * change timer hook implementation to call
    idle-queue instead of self implementation
