* merging work

  update both wrappers for diff and merge. they
  both need to make sure a emacs is running so
  they do not hang on waiting for a emacs.

  need to test external diff, external 3 way merge

* working copy / p4

* shell

  make a comand that looks for a shell/term mode.

  if found pop-to-buffer

  if not found detect bash/or zsh with executable-p

  launch the term if so and hook it into the shell ring

  make it keybound to switch to it.

* vpn.

  make it so the vpn does a discovery. loop through all of the
  servers and start the first one that works.

* networking

  finish the route replacement stuff for interfaces.

  inspect the firewalls to see if they are as tight as possible.

* dired

  create a way to zap all the dired buffers.

  see if I can force all dired into a single buffer instead of creating
  one per dir.

* docs

  get it finished. determing whether the buffer can be switched to
  is wrong in the default case in which it should ignore current
  url possibly ?

* WEB

  html is going to html mode, fix that and get it into a ring. put css
  into the ring too.

* cpan

  fucking cpan. copy regular files.

  look in bin for files as well.

  figure out the auto suffix directory bullshit.

* perl

  need xsh2 now

need the virtual box high-jack of the dev-environment real fucking soon.
the broken-ness of the tools is not working anymore.

two highest priorities are perl debugging and pulling out the vm

* navigation

  investigate use of tags yet again

* editing

  fix single quote in lisp

  when adjecent to text even in lisp a square bracket is inserted.
  fix this. just use the damn character i type. even better would
  be if it wrapped the word.

  this may possibly due to insert.

  figure out all the damn magic and figure out how to wrap
  a word in the given parentheses which it can do.

  get the smart insert working where it chooses to insert a pair
  or a single instance.

  doing anything local will require adding a paren to override the
  global default.

  it would be nice to insert a pair and then put the point inside
  the pair with a paren on each side.

* bash

  get the bloody indent working right.

* grail hacking

  when files like elisp bomb it still crashes everything.

* clojure

  get the clojure examples rounded up and on the website. see if there is
  any value to getting clojure running.

  consider getting clojure jack-in/swank going for portable stuff.

* cpan work

  finish up the cpan work with the rewrite. Once the core version is working
  I can rebuild the classic-deps functionality of building a debian package
  on top of it.

  -- the basic stuff is now working, but that auto directory is completely
     breaking everything.

* merging

  do some ediff work. setup tab'ing so that left and right go between the diff panes
  and down/up jumps between the merge pane. left and right should jump from merge
  pane to the correct side.


* templates

 fix perl foreach template

 build the pop-up completion interface for completing a template. it is
 the only way it will be useful.

bind pop to mark command.

* sepia/perl

  need alot of debugging work with sepia/padwalker etc... and using
  the trick from the office script.

* firewall

  Need to get the firewall back on track, fix up the logging and consider
  adding the active defenses back.

  for firewall i want that splunk alternative handling logging. in fact
  I want it for everything.

  get a log view going. preferable as a background.

* perl commit

  need the indentation switching stat. if a
  mode doesn't do it use a external tool. -- update: use perltidy.

* virtualbox

  work out the virtual box filesystem sharing problem. roll a driver
  package if necessary.

get eclipse set up for java, and get ahead of the game. prune out those
release branches in setting up linked folders. make them go to the trunk.

* create a ring for dired.

create wrappers for system name e.g is-linux,is-darwin

dig into the failure to reload a installed package.

finish lisp mode, get all completions, indent levels, and the
other basics done.
