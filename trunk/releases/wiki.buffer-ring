Buffer-Ring

Buffer Ring creates rings of buffers. Cycling within a buffer-ring switches to the next
buffer in the ring until it wraps around. It does not use the buffer LRU list so the
buffers within a ring are always the same until you add or delete buffers from them.

This is a work in progress, not for the casual Emacs user yet.
