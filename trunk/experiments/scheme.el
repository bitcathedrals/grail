;; setup Emacs for hacking scheme.

;; After looking around there are two scheme implementations I find interesting.

;; mzscheme

;; From the PLT scheme family this implementation is very
;; robust,portable,and feature complete. In particular the FFI is
;; reputed to be quite good, and the skill level of the design and
;; implementation is superior.

;; scheme48

;; This one is portable as well. The main feature is scsh.
