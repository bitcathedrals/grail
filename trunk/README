Welcome to Mike Mattie's emacs configuration.

My Emacs configuration is weighted towards development in various
languages and of course Emacs hacking. This file consists of
integration instructions followed by a brief set of key features and
differences from a standard Emacs.

Installation

  1. unpack the tarball or checkout from the repository containing the
     configuration.

  2. at the toplevel of the configuration tree modify load.el by
     changing the my-emacs-dir path to the absolute path of the
     configuration tree (where this document resides).

  3. create a link $HOME/.emacs pointing to load.el at the root of the
     configuration tree.

  My configuration will then be the default for your user.

Major differences:

tab is the dwim completion in as many modes as possible.

() characters are rebound in lisp modes to the [] keys
while shift-() is bound as []. This is only in lisp
modes. It is strange at first but truly awesome in a lisp
mode.

esc        -> is bound like alt-x for easier access.

shift-tab  -> switches to the other window.

alt-tab    -> switches buffers

ctrl-z     -> terminates recursion instead of signalling the window manager
              to minimize Emacs.

the search functions are regex by default.

you may see comments and literal strings underlined. This is the
spell-checker. Ignore or fix as you choose.

Integration:

The usual recommendation for a Emacs user is to learn a default
configuration, incorperating useful bits from others over time.

This configuration allows a user to benefit from the features of
an advanced configuration that is also modular.

It is straightfoward to disable the entirety of my configuration by
changing load-config in load.el to "[name].el" and incorperating the
useful parts bit by bit while benefitting from some basic features
such as extending load-path and normalizing platforms such as
darwin.el.
